# Snowman Holdings Group Website

Welcome to the source code for the official website of **Snowman Holdings Group**, a professional yet fun business site custom-built from the ground up using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Project Overview

This website was designed and developed for **Snowman Holdings Group**, a client seeking a fun-loving yet professional online presence delivered on a budget. To keep development lean while maintaining full control over the site's structure and styling, I chose to host the website via **cPanel** rather than building a custom WordPress theme.

This was a **solo project** — I was responsible for:

- **Client onboarding and communication**
- **Full-stack web development**
- **Graphic design and visual branding**
- **Copywriting and SEO-optimized article writing**
- **Deployment and site launch**
