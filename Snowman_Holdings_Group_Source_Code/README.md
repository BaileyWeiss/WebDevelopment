# Snowman Holdings Group Website | Source Code
[SnowmanHoldingsGroup.com](https://SnowmanHoldingsGroup.com)

Welcome to the source code for the official website of **Snowman Holdings Group**, a professional yet fun business site custom-built from the ground up using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Project Overview

This website was designed and developed for **Snowman Holdings Group**, a client seeking a professional, yet fun-loving, online presence delivered on a budget. To keep development lean while maintaining full control over the site's structure and styling, I chose to host the website via **cPanel** rather than building a custom WordPress theme or utilizing any web content management systems. After all, the client had no interest in updating anything themselves, as they hired me for web maintenance. The plan for the future is to officially transfer over to WordPress so the client can expand their team of marketing managers who may need access to the back-end with low-code functionality. 

This was a **solo project**, I was responsible for:

- **Client onboarding and communication**
- **Full-stack web development**
- **Graphic design and visual branding**
- **Copywriting and SEO-optimized article writing**
- **Deployment and site launch**
