# Diesel Fuel Solutions, LLC — Custom WordPress Theme  
[DieselFuelSolutions.net](https://dieselfuelsolutions.net)

This repository contains the fully custom WordPress theme developed for **Diesel Fuel Solutions, LLC** — a bold, masculine, and professional website tailored to the branding and operational needs of founder **Nick** and his team.

## Project Overview

**Diesel Fuel Solutions, LLC** approached me with a clear vision: a **manly, dark-centered aesthetic** that felt powerful and clean — without relying on any pre-made WordPress themes. This custom theme was developed from the ground up and includes a dynamic set of tools, animations, and integrations designed specifically to meet the client’s branding and functionality goals.

This was a **solo project**. I was responsible for:

- **Custom WordPress theme development**
- **Graphic design and visual branding**
- **Plugin configuration and integration**
- **Copywriting and SEO strategy**
- **Client communication and deployment**

   - WooCommerce setup for future scalability
   - Salesforce form integration using external linking due to iframe security restrictions

> **Salesforce Note:**  
> The client requested an embedded form via iframe; however, due to **Salesforce's security restrictions**, embedding was not feasible. After coordination with Salesforce backend managers, the best solution was to **link out to the form using widget-based CTA buttons** to preserve functionality and design integrity.
