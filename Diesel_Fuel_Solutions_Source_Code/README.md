# Diesel Fuel Solutions, LLC | Custom WordPress Theme  
[DieselFuelSolutions.net](https://dieselfuelsolutions.net)

This repository contains the fully custom WordPress theme developed for **Diesel Fuel Solutions, LLC**. This website was built in a bold, masculine, and professional brand voice tailored to the operational needs of the founder, **Nick**, and his team.

## Project Overview

**Diesel Fuel Solutions, LLC** approached me with a clear vision: a **manly, dark-centered aesthetic** that felt powerful and clean without relying on any pre-made WordPress themes. This custom theme was developed from the ground up and includes a dynamic set of tools, animations, and integrations designed specifically to meet the client’s branding and functionality goals.

This was a **pair project**. I was responsible for:

- **Custom WordPress theme development**
- **Graphic design and visual branding**
- **Plugin configuration and integration**
- **Copywriting and SEO strategy**

My partner was responsible for:

- **Client communication**

## Timeline

This project took approximately **5 months** to complete, with extended rounds of feedback and refinement on both design and copy. Key milestones included:

1. **Month 1: Discovery & Direction**
   - Moodboarding, competitor analysis, and dark theme exploration
   - Initial design proposals and plugin selection

2. **Month 2–3: Theme Development**
   - Fully custom WordPress theme written from scratch
   - Dynamic fields created with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)
   - Page builder support through Elementor

3. **Month 4: Content & Integration**
   - Full SEO-optimized copywriting
   - WooCommerce setup for future scalability
   - Salesforce form integration using external linking due to iframe security restrictions (this was an unexpected rework)

4. **Month 5: Testing & Launch**
   - Performance optimization
   - Cross-browser testing and mobile responsiveness
   - Final deployment and client walkthrough

## Tech Stack & Plugins

| Category     | Tools Used                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Platform     | WordPress (Custom Theme)                   |
| Page Builder | Elementor and Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)                                   |
| Extra Plugins| WooCommerce, Jetpack, Animation Addon      |
| SEO Tools    | Yoast SEO, Custom Schema Markup            |
| Contact/CRM  | External Salesforce Form via Widget Link   |

> **Salesforce Note:**  
> The client requested an embedded form via iframe; however, due to **Salesforce's security restrictions**, embedding was not feasible. After coordination with Salesforce backend managers, the best solution was to **link out to the form using widget-based CTA buttons** to preserve functionality and design integrity.
