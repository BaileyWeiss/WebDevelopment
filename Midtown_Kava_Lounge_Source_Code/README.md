# Midtown Kava Lounge Website  
[MidtownKavaLounge.com](https://midtownkavalounge.com)

This repository contains the source code and assets for **Midtown Kava Lounge**, a calming, green-themed website built for a relaxing kava bar experience in collaboration with **Capital City Kava**. The site was developed from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, hosted on **cPanel** for ease of management and low maintenance.

## Project Overview

The client wanted a simple, clean site that focused heavily on **green tones**, reflecting the brand’s logo and natural, plant-forward atmosphere. Since much of the brand identity already existed, including the logo and style guide, some copy (like the menu and team bios), and general structure development was able to proceed quickly and efficiently.

As with my other projects, this was a **solo effort**. I was responsible for:

- **Web design and custom code development**
- **Graphic design and visual assets**
- **Editorial and headshot photography**
- **Blog writing and content creation**
- **Deployment and client onboarding**

## Timeline

The website was fully built and deployed over the course of **2 months**, thanks to existing assets and fast client feedback. Key phases included:

1. **Week 1–2: Setup & Visual Direction**
   - Review of existing logo and brand elements
   - Layout planning and green-focused color palette

2. **Week 3–4: Photography & Design**
   - On-location photography for staff and ambiance
   - Graphics designed in-house to maintain a cohesive identity

3. **Week 5–6: Development & Content Integration**
   - Custom HTML/CSS/JS build
   - Menu and team bios formatted and styled
   - Blog articles written to improve organic SEO

4. **Week 7–8: Deployment & Feedback Loop**
   - Hosted via **cPanel** for lightweight management
   - Post-launch feature added: **anonymous feedback button** using an external Google Form
