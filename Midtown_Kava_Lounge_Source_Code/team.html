                    </center>
                    <div class="text">
                      <p>As the owner of Midtown Kava Lounge, it’s my obligation to keep my patrons happy and the business up and running. When I took over in 2020, I truly believed I could foster a strong community that would be similar to how I grew up. I was born and raised in Buffalo, New York where I grew up in an Italian/German neighborhood that deeply ingrained values of community and sharing. Being the third-generation American of my family, I wanted to carry out the legacy of the “American Dream” that my family gave everything for.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Upon assuming ownership of MKL, I aspired to transform the business's reputation, presenting it as an establishment genuinely dedicated to aiding individuals in their life goals. Since then, I am proud to say that we at MKL have helped to invest in small businesses, good causes, and good people.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      In addition to my enthusiasm for community and business, finance has always captivated me. It was my favorite movie, <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i> directed by Martin Scorsese, that initially sparked my interest in this realm. While the high-energy chaos of <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i> might seem an unlikely source of inspiration, for me, it was a catalyst. Returning from a military deployment and grappling with unforeseen mental health challenges, the movie sparked a curiosity in me about financial markets, investing, and wealth creation. The underpinning narrative of harnessing control over one’s financial destiny interested me. I immersed myself in learning, devouring books like <i>Rich Dad Poor Dad</i> written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, and <i>The Intelligent Investor</i> written by Benjamin Graham, to build a foundational understanding of money management and investment strategies. My journey saw me navigate through the volatile waves of Bitcoin and discover a more steady path with S&P 500 ETFs and thoughtful stock evaluations.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      This personal odyssey within the realms of finance and business transcended mere monetary pursuits—it was a lifeline when I faced uncertainty regarding my health and future employability. These pursuits became more than hobbies; it was a means to forge my path and establish a semblance of stability amid the chaos.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Your journey with Midtown Kava Lounge is backed by this spirit. It’s more than a business; it’s a testament to perseverance, continuous learning, and the unwavering belief that we can navigate through challenges and carve out our destiny. Together, let’s embark on a journey where your financial dreams are not only valid but achievable.

                  <div class="text">
                      <p>My name is Colby and I am the Manager here at MKL. I’m currently working through my MS Ed.S in clinical mental health counseling at FSU. Besides my education, I am also really passionate about beach/water activities, traveling, and the Tampa Bay Lightning ice hockey team! MKL has provided me with a sense of community where I can be unapologetically myself and you can too–even if you’re a Florida Panthers fan, but don’t come at me saying they’re the best because I’m <b><i>competitive</i></b>. It’s very comforting to know that my kava family will always have my back and will always be willing to help me no matter what I’m going through.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      If you want my opinion, the best drink at MKL is a tiki shot. Although tiki shots lose some points in the taste category, the feeling is amazing and honestly, I’ve managed the taste for the last two-ish years so– I believe in you! I can also promise you, if you want a tiki, you will not be the only one.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      As the MKL manager, I’ve helped a lot through tough times at the bar and am very proud of all of the improvements and achievements we’ve been able to accomplish. I’m here to help you enjoy your stay with us, so don’t be shy to come talk to me. After all, you’ll know if I’m in the bar immediately if you see the big white fluffy Great Pyrenees sitting on the couch. Her name is China and while she is the mascot here at MKL, she’s also my beloved dog.

                  <p>I’ve been a kava tender and assistant manager (commonly referred to as the ass man; short for assistant manager) at Midtown Kava Lounge since May of 2023. In my spare time, I enjoy watching football and anime, playing video games, and hanging out with my dog Bailey. My favorite part of MKL is the community. I always look forward to seeing my friends and sharing a good laugh over a bunch of tikis. Tikis are my favorite. I believe my most significant contribution to MKL is the sex appeal I bring to the table. The MKL community would be nothing without my luscious hair and extremely handsome features. If you come into MKL and can’t find me, look for someone laughing and they're most likely catching the comedic brilliance I am constantly unleashing. In all seriousness though, I’m dedicated to bringing everyone who walks into MKL the best kava experience and am committed to providing a safe and comfortable place for all members of the community. I hope to see you soon. Bula!</p>

Every holiday I've spent at MKL encapsulates the close bonds that have developed in the five years the bar has been open.

                        <br>
                        My favorite drink at MKL is from the secret menu called a "deconstructed Kraddy Daddy." It's 4 ounces of concentrate in a separate glass with a side of strawberry lemonade. Some contributions I have made to the bar include: having the new logo made for the past rebranding; hosting events such as Memorial Day charity event; welcoming new customers with a detailed discussion of what the products are and how they scientifically work; helping formalize the recipe for our organic Southeast Asian leaf extract, and helping the community with a variety of other needs. Customers should know that I have lived a lot of lives and am open to discussing most topics and facets of social life. A fun fact about me is that I am a trinket connoisseur and collector of oddities.

                        In all seriousness, MKL is a great space with good people. While the bar has seen the different eras of regulars, so have I. I love talking to customers about their hobbies. Mine include Pokemon, dogs, Hot Wheels, hockey, and different collectibles like coins or women (just kidding). You will always find me wearing an anime shirt or hanging out with my friends. If you are looking for a cool place to chill, come hang out with us and you won’t regret it.
